          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>When comparing the median income for a state with its percentage of smokers, it appears that there is a strong correlation between the two.
            The data indicates that lower income states have higher percentage of smokers and states with higher median incomes tend to have a lower percentage of smokers.
          </p>

          <p>The six states with the hights percentage of smokers and lowest income average are all concidered to be southern states. 
            It would be interesting to see if the rest of the data showed that these states also contain higher rates of 
            poverty, obesity and lower healthcare rates.
          </p>

          <p>An interesting observation concerns Utah being an outlier. Though its median income is concidered average, its percentage of smokers is the lowest out of any state, followed by California.
            This is something that would require a lot more data to understand why, but it would be interesting to find out if there is something beyond income
            that is driving this.
